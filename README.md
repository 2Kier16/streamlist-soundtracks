🎬🎵 StreamList: Movie Soundtrack Edition

StreamList is a React‑based web app that lets users explore, catalog, and manage their favorite movie soundtracks and composers.  
Designed with a modern lavender‑and‑purple theme, intuitive navigation, and expressive iconography, StreamList is built for music lovers, film buffs, and anyone who wants to track the scores that move them.

- **Album cards** showing cover art, artist name, and release year with improved dark‑theme CSS contrast/shadow styling
- **Expandable album view** with *View Tracks* button wired to Spotify’s album API (track display logic in progress)

- **Graceful error handling** when searches return no results
- **Responsive navigation bar** with dynamic cart count and routing via React Router
- **Login/Logout buttons** in navigation (future feature) — planned for secure account creation and personalized soundtrack collections

## Technologies Used
- React (Hooks + Functional Components)
- React Router DOM
- React Icons
- CSS Flexbox + Scoped Styling (`MovieSoundTracks.css`, `Home.css`)
- JSX
- Git & GitHub
- External APIs:
  - **Spotify** for album/soundtrack data and track listings
  - TheAudioDB (legacy support, being phased out)
  - Last.fm (legacy track listings, being phased out)
- Jest + React Testing Library for automated UI testing

## Ethical Design Note
Authentication is not yet implemented, but future versions will include secure password handling using hashing and salting techniques.  
These practices reflect Stage 1 and Stage 2 of password protection and align with ethical standards for user privacy and data security.

---

## Current Limitations
- Search results depend on what’s available in the free Spotify catalog; some titles may not appear, while many composers and albums are fully indexed
- Advanced search panel is styled and functional in the UI, but search logic is still being finalized
- Track display logic for the *View Tracks* button is in progress
- Login/Logout buttons are placeholders until account authentication is implemented

## Project Status
- **Week 3 Deliverables:** Cart system completed with album/track add, quantity adjustment, removal, and total price calculation. Cart contents persist via localStorage.
- **Advanced Search:** Panel styled and functional, with multiple filter inputs; search logic integration in progress.
- **Navigation Bar:** Dynamic cart count updates in real time.
- **Issues/Risks:** Minor CSS nesting errors corrected; subscription duplication bug resolved.
- **Week 4 Deliverables:** Jest test suite stabilized with global router mocks; `App.test.js` simplified; `HomeCartFlow.test.js` covers add and remove flows with passing results.
- **Week 5 Deliverables:** Spotify search integrated into Home and MovieSoundTracks pages; styling fixes applied for dark theme readability.
- **Next Steps:** Finalize track display logic, polish styling, and complete login/logout feature for personalized accounts.
